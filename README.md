# Final-Planner-App

This is a simple web application that allows employees with busy schedules to manage their time effectively by adding important events to a daily planner. The app displays the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner, and presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down. Each timeblock is color-coded based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed, so that users can easily see which events are coming up and which have already passed.

## Usage

To use the app, simply click on a timeblock and enter an event. When you're done, click the save button in that timeblock to save the event in local storage. The app will persist events between refreshes of a page, so you don't have to worry about losing your schedule if you accidentally close the app or refresh the page.
